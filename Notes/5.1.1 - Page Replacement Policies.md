# Page Replacement Policies

- Invoked on a pagefault (on demand)
- Also an be run periodically as an OS background progress
  - Go through and find pages that haven't been used recently to kick ouy
  - Maintain a pool of free frames
- Modified bit (M)
  - Page changed in memory

## Policies

### Min Policy (Belady's algorithm)

- Discard page to be used furthest in future
- Considered to be an ideal or optimal policy
  - Causes the least amount of page faults
- This algorithm cannot be properly implemented as we have no way of determine when specific pages will be needed
  - Can be simulated
- Gives us a yardstick
  - AKA gives us a representation of the best case scenario

### Least Recently used (LRU)

- Use history
- Always replace page used farthest in past
- Difficult to implement
  - We need timestamps on pages
  - Need to maintain sorted list based off the timestamps

### Not Recently Used (NRU)

- Not exact or deterministic
  - More realistic than LRU
- Use reference bit (R)
  - When a page is accessed, bit is set
- Periodically resets the reference bit
- Four classes of page, kicked out in priority
  - 1: R = 0, M = 0
  - 2: R = 0, M = 1
  - 3: R = 1, M = 0
  - 4: R = 1, M = 1

### Clock Algorithm

- "Clock hand" pointing through every page
- if (R == 0) replace
- else reset R to 0
- advance the hand

### FIFO

- First in first out
- Discard oldest page - ignore reference pattern

## Locality of a reference

- Top of the stack
- Variables for the current function being executes are more likely to be used than something deeper on the stack
- Instructions in tight loop
  - These keep getting used over and over again, so the page that contains them will keep getting used

## Working set

- For a process: its the pages needed for execution

## Global vs local policies

- Global: Consider all pages from all processes
- Local: Consider only pages from currently running process

## Locking pages in memory

- Pages that are not able to be kicked out
  - Page replacement code
  - Pages that are part of DMA (direct memory access)

## Page Reference Strings

- Generate a fault rate graph
- X axis is the frame count, and Y axis is the page fault count
  - Usually an exponentially decreasing curve
- Example:
  > ex: 0 1 2 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 4 
  - Assuming FIFO
  - 3 frames
  - Pure demand paging
  - Steps:
    - [012] Pages 0 1 2 wil be loaded, each causing a page fault.
      - 'cold start' page faults (not yet filled up frames)
      - The rest are 'warm start' meaning frames are being used and stuff now must be kicked out.
    - [123] Then page 3 is loaded, dropping page 0 causing a page fault
    - [230] Then page 0 is loaded, dropping page 1 and causing a page fault
    - [304] Then page 4 is loaded, dropping page 2 and causing a page fault
    - [---] Then 0 and 1 are accessed again
    - [042] Then 2 is loaded, dropping 0
    - [423] Then 3 is loaded, dropping 1
    - [---] Then 4 is accessed
    - **9 total page faults**
  - Same as before but with 4 frames
    - [0123] each a page fault
    - [----] no page fault loading 0 and then loading 1
    - [1234] page fault generated and dropped 0
    - [2340] page fault reading 0, dropped 1
    - .... So on so forth - will generate **10 total page faults** instead
  - FIFO is a bad algorithm as as you allocate more frames, it does not guarantee less page faults will occur
