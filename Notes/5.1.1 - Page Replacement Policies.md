# Page Replacement Policies

- Invoked on a pagefault (on demand)
- Also an be run periodically as an OS background progress
  - Go through and find pages that haven't been used recently to kick ouy
  - Maintain a pool of free frames
- Modified bit (M)
  - Page changed in memory

## Policies

### Min Policy (Belady's algorithm)

- Discard page to be used furthest in future
- Considered to be an ideal or optimal policy
  - Causes the least amount of page faults
- This algorithm cannot be properly implemented as we have no way of determine when specific pages will be needed
  - Can be simulated 
- Gives us a yardstick
  - AKA gives us a representation of the best case scenario

### Least Recently used (LRU)

- Use history
- Always replace page used farthest in past
- Difficult to implement
  - We need timestamps on pages
  - Need to maintain sorted list based off the timestamps

### Not Recently Used (NRU)

- Not exact or deterministic
  - More realistic than LRU
- Use reference bit (R) 
  - When a page is accessed, bit is set
- Periodically resets the reference bit
- Four classes of page, kicked out in priority
  - 1: R = 0, M = 0
  - 2: R = 0, M = 1
  - 3: R = 1, M = 0
  - 4: R = 1, M = 1

### Clock Algorithm

- "Clock hand" pointing through every page
- if (R == 0) replace 
- else reset R to 0
- advance the hand

### FIFO

- First in first out
- Discard oldest page - ignore reference pattern
