# Unix IPC

Software Interrupts

- per-process basis, not thread
  - There are 32 different types that the handler can interpret all part of an interrupt table
    - Interrupt key: ^c
    - When a child process is completed, an interrupt is sent to parent
    - When there is an alarm - message to be send after x seconds (like wait)
    - If a program divides by 0 - causes a CPU hardware interrupt. Hardware interrupt is forwarded to the software directly

## SendInterrupt(pid, num)

where pid is process id and num is interrupt number

- OS can send an interrupt, and one process can interrupt another
- In unix/linux
  - kill()

## HandleInterrupt(num, handler)

- Can have process ignore specific number
- Terminate on a specific number
- user-supplied function
- All we are doing with this is modifying the default interrupt handler table
- In linux
  - signal() - NOT related to semaphore

## Pipes (depiction in 1.2.1)

Ex: `ls | more`

- This forks two processes off of shell, ls and more
- creates a unidirectional 'pipe' between ls -> more
  - This is effectively a buffer that contains some amount of data.
    - 4k bits / 4096bytes
    - Bounded Buffer Problem (buffer of fixed size)
    - Also a producer/consumer problem
  - Maintained by the OS
- input comes from read-end of pipe
  - input from more will be the output of ls
- If the buffer fills, process on 'read' end will block
- if the process on the 'reading' end reads an empty pipe, it blocks

## Client/server communication

conceptual overview, not a true networks lecture

- Ports
  - Similar to a mailbox
  - Client does not send directly to the server process, though sends to the port on the system in which the server process exist
- Socket
  - End-point for communication
  - Ports are bound to a specific socket
- Typical communication:
  - Server machine has an open port of 80
  - The server process binds port 80 to a socket
    - Effectively makes it so any information sent to port 80 will be automatically forwarded to the endpoint the process created
  - To send to the server:
    - client must know the port and the internet address (or internal address if local)
    - Client will open a socket on its system
    - When the client goes to communicate with the server, the os will create a dynamic port
  - Now a request can be sent to the server
    - Client sends to port 80 -> forwards to the server processes open socket
    - Server process will handle and send back a response to that dynamically allocated port -> forwarded to the client process socket
