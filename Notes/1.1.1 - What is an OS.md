# What is an OS?

- Manages resources
- Abstracts hardware

## Diagram of computer hierarchy

User --- Human\
|\
|   **<---- Interface (Program interface)**\
|\
Application program --- compiler/editor\
|\
|   **<---- Interface (System calls)**\
|\
Operating System --- serves process requests\
|\
|   **<---- Interface (Hardware/privileged instructions)**\
|\
Hardware --- CPU, Memory, Disk, CDROM

## Processes

- Program => code + data
  - This is then executed by the system

## Resources

- Things that the OS manages
  - Physical Hardware (CPU, RAM, I/O, Networking, etc.)
  - Non-physical (Files/Process are an abstraction of the OS)

## Services Provided

- Context switching and scheduling
- Memory management
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Access to filesystem
- I/O
